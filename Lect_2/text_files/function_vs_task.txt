A function is meant to do some processing on the input and return a single value,
whereas a task is more general and can calculate multiple result values and return
them using output and inout type arguments. Tasks can contain simulation time 
consuming elements such as @, posedge and others.

  Both task and function are methods in Verilog and they have the ability to split up 
a large code or procedure into smaller ones to make it easier to understand.Although
both of them are methods but still there are a large number of differences:

a) Task can enable both a task and function but function can only enable a function.

b) A task can contain timing control constructs like delays and all and therefore
can execute in non zero simulation time while function should not contain any delay
or event and therefore always execute in zero simulation time.

c) A task cannot return a value but has the ability to pass multiple values through
output and input arguments but functions can return a single value and should not 
use either output or input arguments.

d) Disable statements can be used in a task means a task can be terminated using a
disable statement but a function can not be terminated using disable.

e) A task can use zero or more arguments which are of type input,output or input but
for function there should be at least one input argument needs to be passed.

f) A task can only be synthesized if it does not contain any timing construct while
a function is always synthesized.

g) A task is typically used within a statement while a function is called within a
expression.
